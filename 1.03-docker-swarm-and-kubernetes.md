=== Docker Swarm and Kubernetes
**Speaker: Sam Alba/Andrea Luzzardi**

Kelsey shirt: Docker

* Using Swarm to make Kubernetes deployment easier
* Swarm as a proxy in front of your cluster with a scheduler
* Why use
    * native docker 
    * same experience everywhere (cloud, local, etc.)
    * Swarm 1.0 is ready
* Swarm 1.0
    * stateful services via docker volumes
    * network micro segmentation
    * scale to 1,000 nodes (with 30K containers) - benchmark detail coming in a blog in one week (DockerCon EU)
* deploy Kubernetes demo
    * only docker native tools
    * simple and consistent
    * consistent network stack
    * uses docker-compose to describe/deploy kubernetes
    * Instances have OS and docker and swarm
    * creates a multi-region network (using Docker 1.9 networking)
    * kubelet in container, mounted to docker socket (uses same engine as Swarm)
    * can use both docker command and kubectl (same engine in use)
* Works with other solutions (Mesos, Nomad, whatever). Interesting provisioning
* code at github.com/docker/swarm-frontends
