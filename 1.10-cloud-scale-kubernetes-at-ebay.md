=== Cloud-Scale Kubernetes at eBay
**Speaker: Ashwin Raveendra**

Kelsey shirt: Pachyderm

* Stack is DC -> IaaS (homegrown/openstack) -> services (DB, security, logging, monitoring, etc) -> App
* Runs a OS with a eBay host agent (know what app state should be on the machines) is a tar (see slide)
* mandate a single VM per application is the model. Introduces problems: frameworks are hard (like logging)
* Would like to move to Kub to solve this
* app stack is Java
* They want to distribute firewall and load-balancing to all nodes
* Challenges:
    * networking
        * OpenStack does not have right primitives (Route)
        * different network design ins area
        * Internal IPv4 is limited. A constraint
    * security
        * Integrate with OpenStack Keystone
        * container security (selinux, etc.)
        * Distributed firewall
        * Native PKI on kube (cfssl/lemur)
    * Storage
        * OpenStack cinder 
        * local storage leases
    * Scale
        * 5-20K servers per zone
        * cluster federation needed
