=== Moving to Kubernetes: Tales from SoundCloud
**Speaker: Tobias Schmidt**

Kelsey T-Shirt: OpenShift

* http://prometheus.io check it out
* Was a ruby stack. monolithic
* Slow scaling was a problem and deployments were fragile and state could become inconsistent. Dev-prod parity not there. Chef took developers a long time to get going.
* Built Bazooka - like heroku or git
    * 12-factor
    * immutable revisions (git based)
    * declarative deploys
* strength
    * make teams independent. not need for Ops to build machines.
    * deploys and rollback worked
    * scaling worked (as long as capacity)
    * orchestration is not critical path (not needed for production to run)
* Learnings
    * containers are the only way (400-500 services)
    * Golang a great fit for Bazooka
* Challenges/learnings
    * monitoring deployed services is complex
    * used graphite with lots of bottlenecks, so used Prometheus
    * Used kudzu? but was abandoned. Led to a SPOF.
    * use a common integration service (like apiserver in Kub)
    * resource isolation was an afterthought and became a problem.
    * automate everything - opinionated deployment for each team. Leave _everything_ to the pipeline. (How can we handle secrets?)
* chose Kubernetes over Mesos
    * user only cares about the simple Kube objects (container, pods, service, rc)
    * Powerful networking - How are they doing security/auditing, etc.)
    * Pod scheduling - sidecar pods for things like metrics scraping (sending to Prometheus)
    * label system. Users just need to understand this. decouple pod life-cycle from availability life-cycle.
    * Big community
* what's next?
    * not in production yet
    * comparing on-prem, GCE, AWS. Will use bare-metal. How is he staging kub?
    * want to know how folks solve logging
