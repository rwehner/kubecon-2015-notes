**Speaker: Yuvi Panda**

Kelsey T-Shirt: NGinx

* 2.5 people and volunteers
* everything is OSS
* crazy, organic infra to start with
* no standards for the applications. People do what they want.
* cannot increase the barrier to entry.
* Requirements
    * user don't have to change things
    * But allow people to use modern tools
    * provides modern, Heroku type PaaS.
    * interoperate with current setup
* Kubernetes
    * 2 months in
    * Building backward-compat layer
    * will run code off of mounted NFS.
    * Also offer direct access to K8s
    * A real PaaS many 6+ months out
*  don't write your own code if you don't have to. big ball of mud problem
*  Using carrots to move users, not stick (we need to adopt this approach, I think)
