=== Kubernetes is for Monoliths too
**Speaker: Steve Reed**

Kelsey T-Shirt: SignalFx

* Everyone should consider Kub when modernizing
* Don't deploy the monolith as-is (Titanic)
* Containerize the monolith
    * volume mounts where possible
        * configuration
        * persistent storage
        * logs
    * Secrets
    * Resource limits?
* start with a podolith, then refactor slowly as it makes sense.
* Hard-code stuff in the config
* services without selectors to integrate with outside things
* reverse-proxy adapter for TLS or authentication, etc.
* bind to default ports since your pod has its own IP space
