* Legacy problems
    * expensive at scale
    * snowflakes
    * less automation
    * hard to change
* The public cloud
    * deployment format
    * nice services
    * Cost is correlated to allocation
    * capacity
    * fault domains
    * But, also have interference, noisy neighbor, vendor lock in,
* Next: Private clouds (twitter/Apple)
    * exclusive access
    * Predictable cost and performance
    * custom hardware
    * security and compliance may be easy
    * But, need a team of experts to do this. Lots of reinvention. resource silos
* hybrid cloud
* Prediction:
    * more clouds
    * workload will flow to where it makes sense
    * program against the datacenter (form factor)
    * Declarative configuration won't be enough by itself
    * Learn your users needs via observation
