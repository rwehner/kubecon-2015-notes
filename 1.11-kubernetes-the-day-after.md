=== Kubernetes, The Day After
**Speaker: Neeraj Gupta**

Kelsey shirt: Triton

* How do you trust the app and deps?
* where does it run?
* Policy: the best tool to
    * get out of way of Dev
    * let Ops do operations
    * Enough guardrails to allow the right things and protect others
* Kubernetes provides:
* resource limits
* Object number limits
* Limits can be per namespace
* Can set default limits
* Each cloud is different
* but, Policy has to be available everywhere
* Kube needs ability to have policy on network (and disk to a lesser extent)
* Tips:
    * lots of sandboxes (per user)
    * apply policy low (close to leaves)
    * generate policy with automation
* Apcera does this stuff above
