* Must virtualize the network
    * Many ways to do this
    * Much choice mean we need a pluggable system
* Lots of choices for how to allocate IPs

* What is CNI?
    * containers can join multiple networks
    * network describe by json
    * plugin must support add/delete commands
* walk-thru of how this is done in a plugin (but using bash)
