=== Closing Keynote: Kubernetes Cluster Federation ("Ubernetes")
**Speaker: Quinton Hoole**

* DC's are cattle too
* cluster has constraints too.
* Ubernetes: federation of clusters
* why?
    * HA
        * Infrastructure upgrades
        * bad releases
        * etc.
    * Application migration
    * Policy enforcement
        * keep data in places where the law says it should be (by label, etc.)
        * Some BUs use expensive equipment, some don't
        * auditing: funneling through central control makes this easier.
    * Avoid vendor lock-in
    * Capacity overflow
* Challenges
    * different clusters in different DCs have different characteristics
    * how to consolidate monitoring/alerting/auditing
    * service discover is hard
    * Cross-cluster load-balancing
        * GeoDNS, perhaps
        * route around busy, but healthy clusters
        * detect down and move traffic elsewhere
    * Location affinity
* Status:
    * Lite in alpha Q4 2015
    * productionized Q1 2016
    * real federation alpha Q1 2016
    * GKE Q1-2
