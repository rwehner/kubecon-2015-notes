=== Rebasing onto Kubernetes
**Speaker: Matt Butcher**

Kelsey shirt: DataDog

* Deis
    * containerized PAAS
    * Easy as Heroku
    * Run on own infra
    * Pick what you like
* Uses Ceph for storage
* "Builder" does the Heroku magic
* scheduler isn't the right place to make thing swappable for Deis
* Kubernetes is the platform (the Os no longer matters)
* Stop worrying about docker, etc. Kubernetes worries about it.
* v1 Deis was tightly coupled, despite philosophy
* v2 much more microservices
* Turtles all the way down
    * security pod -> qemu -> linux -> docker -> image builder
        * IO is really horrible in this mighty turtle stack
* Bartleby effect
    * Struggled with managing manifests
    * few real-world examples
    * Dearth of manifest tools
    * steep learning curve
    * How to fix this? Decided to build a tool
        * Helm: a homebrew-like tool for Kubernetes (http://helm.sh)
* Lot of areas where we wanted shared Etcd
    * don't use the Kub Etcd, had to run robust etcd in Kubernetes
        * discover pod
        * RCs with etcd
        * Needed images with the idea of the cluster in mind.
        * Invested in custom bootstrap in Go to self-tune the pods to know the cluster
        * The bootstrap introspects on bootup to get past self-healing, starting new pods, etc.
* Service is part of the consumer
    * Move service into the app, not the provider (i.e. DB service is in the app, but the DB RC is not)
    * Look at the To-Do app in the `example/` area of the Helm repo
