=== Opening Keynote
**Speaker: Brendan Burns**

* Kubernetes 1.1 release today
* Make reliable, scalable, agile a CS101 exercise
* must have agility and reliability
* demo: 1mm r/s then rolling update
* resource allocation allows both load and work in same cluster.
* v1.1
    * http load balancing
        * we can replace our F5 with this (or mostly). Terminate SSL on F5, send everything to the ingress point.
        * Ingress type provides the path-mapping, domain-mapping
        * Ingress controllers need to be written: GCE and HA-Proxy exist now
    * Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
        * Kind: horizontalPodAutoscaler
        * currently uses CPU or Memory as metrics to drive events
        * Thinking about how to do 'vertical' scaling later
    *  jobs API
        * batch jobs - beginning
        * `Kind: Job`
        * How many times to run (completions). Runs each in parallel
        * can set `parallelism`
        * foundation for cron, workflow, etc. but those aren't in place yet.
    * Resource overcommit
        * Memory overcommit (guaranteed, burstable, best effort)
        * based on `request`s and `limit`s
        * "best effort" are the first ones to die when resources are overburdened.
    * IPTables-based kube-proxy
        * this is optional. It is beta
        * Will become the only implementation in 1.2 (probably)
        * Will preserve the source address
        * Much reduced latency
    * `kubectl`
        * Interactive (`run`, `attach`)
        * `edit` - edit active API definition
        * `apply`
    * rollingupdate improvements
        * wait until new pod is healthy, before moving on.
        * pause on terminal failure of new pod (use `--rollback` when things go awry)
* Long term
    * Just his idea.
    * App dev is distributed without have to do anything different
* v1,2
    * Deployment manager
    * Helm
    * Focused on "make apps"
    * Federated Kubernetes - TBD. need input
        * cross-cluster import/export
    * new UX (dashboard)
    * Simplified configuration
* participate!
