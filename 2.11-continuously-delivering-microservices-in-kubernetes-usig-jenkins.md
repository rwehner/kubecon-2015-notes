=== Continuously Delivering Microservices in Kubernetes Using Jenkins
**Speaker: Sandeep Parikh**

Kelsey T-Shirt:

* CI needs to be bullet-proof. Very deterministic
* A black box that just dumps out the right stuff in any environment
* Keep hands off `kubectl`
* Why continuous?
    * fail fast and early
    * blame fast (not blame, but need to know)
    * deliver faster
* Tons of options for CI. We'll look at Jenkins in Kub
* 1st build Jenkins leader in cluster
* Use the Jenkins Workflow plugin (not freestyle)
* define flexible script-based pipeline
* Support human input/approval
* github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/continuous-deployment-on-kubernete
* Other docs to see
