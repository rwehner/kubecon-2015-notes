* PaaS disappearing? replace with composable blocks
* PaaS still adds the good end-user experience. How to get devs more productive
* How to get one platform for both stateful and stateless apps. stateful not well handled now or similarly handled.
* There's a reason why so many workflows develop. like opinions. People will still want choice.
* key building block not defined well
    * shared volumes
    * network integration
    * standards
* What opinions from Heroku-style to know have changed?
    * http-only no longer applies
    * not treating data as a thing outside of the cluster
    * architecture is not so much n-tier to DB.
* Which opinions should be valid?
    * Specialization of Operations
        * Enterprise don't want wild west. Don't want so much choice.
        * Would like to see a personalized PaaS that give the organization the PaaS they want.
    * how to containerize traditional app. Not only one way.
