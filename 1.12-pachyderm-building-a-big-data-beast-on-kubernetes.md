**Speaker: Joe Doliner**

kelsey shirt: Triton

* copy-on-write FS
    * git for huge datasets (diffs, revert etc.)
    * reliability (immutable FS)
* Pipeline
* reactive pipeline
* triggered by commits
* workflow/dependencies
* 
* cost-effective resource mgmt: storage nodes and compute clusters
    * Can delay work until it is cost-effective
*  can use FS by itself if desired
*  code: github.com/pachyderm/packyderm

* expect a use-able release early next year.
