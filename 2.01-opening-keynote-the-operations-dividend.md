=== Opening Keynote: The Operations Dividend
**Speaker: Joe Beda**

Kelsey T-Shirt: OpenShift

* need some nuance around Devops. Can do better than everyone is in everyone's business.
* What's a microservice?
    * break up app with well defined boundaries own teama dnt timelimes
    * discovery service is the 'linker'
* next way is break things down further?: pico-services
    * can be taken to an unnatural extreme. WE don't want that?
* Microservice about people, not code. Small team can be responsible for it.
* smaller teams operate better
* also supported by Conways' law - make the organization follow the boundaries of your app. ;-)
* As service grows, break it up again.
* Service spectrum
    * service as implementation detail
    * shared artifact, private instance: i.e., database, but private instance, queue or whatever
    * shared instance: serves many customers (databases), shared message classifier, intake, branding html service
        * leads to a "service network": messy, but a good thing. needs some innovation.
    * BigS services: sendgrid - need security, hard-limit quotas, etc. Lots of new stuff
* Operations
    * SRE vs. Ops
        * keep service up and running, but do so by improving processes and tools to innovate out of job. Great relationship with Dev. Dev competes to get the SRE resources. Very highly respected. SRE auditions the dev teams to prove that they deserve SRE take-over.
            * do you do a real post-mortem. Do you really make the changes, run drills, correct the problem. This is the difference.
    * not generalize. make sense to specialize. Let them become expert at that.
    * OS Ops
        * solid OS team.Well-defined SLAs
    * cluster Ops
        * logical infra over physical infra
        * Most benefit when the cluster expertise is well spread
    * application Ops - bridge between Ops and Dev app teams. High touch and the interface is not well defied and changeable. Same goals.
    *  These do not overlap significantly. They are big domains and need expertise. There are other Ops roles.
* Ops costing (worth thinking about reducing the Ops cost)
    * every service has a cost and more complex services cost more as they scale.
    * there is a sweet spot for microservices where they fit in terms of cost/complexity. But not for all apps.
    * Kub is to reduce the complexity constant
* The Ops dividend: as tools improve, we'll have more Ops capacity.
