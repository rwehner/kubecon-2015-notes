== Network booting Kubernetes
* Cameron Bruner
* immutable OS
* PXE booting
* boot-time stuff like cloud-int
* treat hardware like cattle
    * always network boot
    * immutable Os
    * user cloud-int and then systemd to drive config (systemd for things like TLS certs)
    * host images locally (OS)
* They use Atomic default RPMs
* This is the NavOps project all bundled. (look for it next week)

== Rust for Kubernetes Deployment
* KAWS
* jimmy cuadra
* reproducible (for AWS, CoreOs, TerraForm, Kuberetes)
* KAWS Goals:
    * Infrastructure as code
    * production grade Kubernetes cluster
    * secure access credentials
    * avoid shell scripting as much as possible
* RUST - good choice for CLI
* uses GPG pub key to track users
* Look into how he is doing TLS assets (encryption, etc.)
* manages users creds. Can we piggyback on this or take it out?
* code at github.com/inquicker/kaws

== Intro to Eclipse Che
* cloud-based IDE
* The project should just work (workspace is in cloud and managed by IDE)
* Che is not released yet
* localhost experience in the browser
* trying to keep devs from having to work with containers directly
* openshift.com - the codeenvy IDE to be beta by early next year?

== Application Routing on Kubernetes
* Twitter story
* rpc/traffic (finagle.github.io)
* observability (zipkin)
* apps don't need to know how the RPC layer is being manipulated.
* currently uses a sidecar in kubernetes
* creates headless service for the Buoyant router
* can do very specific routing

== Flawcheck
* container security
* flawcheck does checks in the CI pipeine and after deployed to production
* flawcheck written in Scala. looks for malware and vulnerabilities
* showed current official ubuntu 14.04 image from docker is very messed up.

== Vinli's Farm: Tooling Kubernetes
* connected car platform (4g modem with GPS)
* focused on developers
* wanted a dev-focused solution. Not a devops shop
* container native and 12-factor (  state outside kubernetes)
* any pod as one requirement:
    * app/service -> GET /ping
    * Workers -> send health msg
* shepard - tool replaces rollingupdate
* handles moving from environments.
* foreman - workers - queue manager?
* farmer -
* deletes pods frequently and let everything restart. just to "clean things up"
* butcher - cron-like thing
* config ONLY leaves in Kubernetes
* can just move between clusters by sucking up the config from one, dropping it into a new one.

== Weave Scope
* written in Go. OSS
* generates map of containers
* real-time only. No storage
* tries to do intelligent grouping
* experimental K8s support
* Do not need to run Weave network to use Scope, but it can help?

== Skippbox
* easy start
* develop app locally
* move it to GKE (or other Kubernetes)
* kcompose (coming soon) compose2RC/scv
* all on github. installer coming soon

== Monitoring Kubernetes with Datadog
* 8 surprising facts about docker - paper on how much real usage is
* culture, automation, metrics, sharing == devops.
* gotta know what we care about from a metrics perspectives
* page on "work" metrics, not 'resource' or 'event' metrics.
* Use "resource" metrics to decide action when 'work' ones page
* don't use static configs to track a dynamic infra. (ansible/Nagios are wrong here most likely)
* focus on service level not on host level
* tags, labels, etc are needed to form queries about the infra

== Cluster Scheduling: we can do better
* goo.gl/7yhTqd
* Schedulers are monolithic right now.
* This makes them inflexible and code bloat
* two-level scheduler (Mesos), but scheduler can hoard and information hiding
* shared state model (Omega) - optimistic concurrency
* Kubernetes has a foot in monolithic and shared-state
* Firmament - research project for schedulers
* firmament.io
