**Speaker: Lachlan Evenson/Pedro Marques**

Kelsey T-Shirt: CoreOS

* look for openstack.org/toyko demo
* Networking is a problem in Kubernetes now
* went for 60 minute deploys to 1 minute
* Making Kube available to the brown field (existing apps) is not easy
* Challenges
    * security
    * multi0tenancy
    * scalable
    * auditability
    * Redundant
    * Compliance
* OpenContrail solves these challenges in Kub.
    * Only need the info from the manifest files to build the network with OC
    * OC has upstreamed most of this work (Ansible/Salt)
* Advice
    * incremental - go after one problem
    * don't get hung up on requirements. Use what exists and then work on the missing stuff.
    * Get it out there and have people use it. learn get folks using it.
* Service advertisement outside the cluster: Exposed via a `LoadBalancer`. OC picks it up.
* Not using it for firewall
* uses federated OC for bare, public cloud, private cloud
