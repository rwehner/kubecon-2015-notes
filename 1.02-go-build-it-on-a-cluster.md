    * use `google.DefaultClient` for GKE auth
    * get certs
    * create cluster http client
    * Use it to talk to API
* Operations
    * `kubectl exec` - help figure out why your stuff id not working. Take care of your cattle. 
    * `kubectl proxy` - use it to explore
* efficiency
    * monitor pod state with the Watch API (hanging `GET`, long poll)
    * Pod declaration is a `var` in the Go code, not a separate yaml file.
    * bufReader consumes the Watch.
* hygiene
    * How to cancel long-running Watch:  use `context` and `ctxhttp`
    * cancel a watch: range over `watchPod`
