=== Framework Agnostic Discovery
**Speaker: Tim Gross**

Kelsey T-Shirt: CoreOS

* Need a container-native architecture to take advantage of the benefits of Kub
* for this need discovery
* containers need to be first class citizens on network (need names and IPs)
* Joyent Linux containers on Solaris zones. With docker interface.
* Docker gave us
    * build docs (Dockerfile)
    * solve works for me
    * fix dependency isolation
    * interface-based approach to application deployment. (logs like this, metrics like this, starts like this)
* NAT kill network performance. See the research
* Hard to solve the above
* DNS is another problem (no health check, not LB but RR, TTL caching)
* Lots of network proxy stuff makes performance bad
* Let's make the app responsible for its own topology.
* won't use sidecars
* use containerbuddy.io - shim to make existing apps fit these needs
